# Hi, I'm Devansh ðŸ‘‹

[![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Kaggle-20BEFF?logo=kaggle&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://www.kaggle.com/your-kaggle-username)

A few example badge/snippets you can use (replace your-kaggle-username):

- Simple Kaggle profile badge (clickable):
```
[![Kaggle](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Kaggle-20BEFF?logo=kaggle&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://www.kaggle.com/your-kaggle-username)
```

- Manual medal/status badges (replace numbers/text as needed):
```
![Kaggle Medals](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gold%20Medals-2-brightgreen)
![Kaggle Medals](https://img.shields.io/badge/Silver%20Medals-5-lightgrey)
![Kaggle Medals](https://img.shields.io/badge/Bronze%20Medals-7-orange)
```

Notes:
- The shields.io badge above only creates a pretty, clickable badge linking to your Kaggle profile.
- If you want the badges to update automatically with your live Kaggle stats (medals, ranking, points), you can use a GitHub Action that:
  1. Uses the Kaggle API (requires Kaggle credentials stored in GitHub Secrets), or
  2. Scrapes your public Kaggle profile page (less robust).
- If you'd like, I can produce a full GitHub Action workflow + script that updates these medal badges automatically in this README on a schedule. Tell me whether you prefer the Kaggle API (youâ€™ll need to add secrets) or a scraper.
